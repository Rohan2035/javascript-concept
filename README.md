  Asynchronous Function:

1) Function running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous.

2) With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in parallel.


Difference betweem Asynchronous Function and Multithreading:

1) Asynchronous allows multiple things happen at a same time. When a program calls a long running function it does not block the execution flow. 

2) Multithreading refers to concurrent/parallel execution of more than one thread

3) In simple words multithreading is all about concurrent execution and async programming is about non-blocking between the functions


Promises in JavaScript:

1) Promise is an object that represents completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its result value.

2) A Promise contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code.

Async and Await in JavaScript:

1) Async and Await makes it easier to write the promises

2) async makes a function return a promise and await makes a function wait for a promise

3) The await keyword can be only used inside the async function. await makes the function pause and wait for resolved promise before it continues.
